# display-ding

I created this to use a Heltec ESP8266 board with an OLED display to show the Status of my laundry machine.
Text on the display is in German, but feel free to fork this repo and change to your likings.

## Features

- Shows cute symbol of a laundry machine
- Laundry machine symbol is animated, if the machine is running
- Uses MQTT to determine the status of the laundry machine
- Uses MQTT with username/password

## Setup

- Rename `config.h.TEMPLATE` to `config.h` and put your WiFi and MQTT settings in.
- Build and flash on your board.
